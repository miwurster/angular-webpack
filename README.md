Tour of Heroes: Editor
----------------------

This is a proof-of-concept [application](https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/tutorial) based on the _Tour of Heroes_ Angular2 tutorial that uses [**webpack**](https://webpack.github.io) as module bundler and a tool for bundling the application.

### Usage

```
npm install
npm start      # Starts the development server
npm run build  # Runs the production build
```

### TODOs

- [x] Basic prod/dev webpack setup
- [x] Implement tutorial _Tour of Heroes_
- [ ] Incorporate unit testing with Karma and Jasmine
- [ ] Incorporate end-to-end testing with Protractor
- [ ] Move to [`angular-cli`](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli)
